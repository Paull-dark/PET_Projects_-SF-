- The target of the project:
To track the impact of living conditions of students aged 15 to 22 on their academic performance in mathematics, in order to identify students at an early stage of risk.

- Data Info:
The data is presented as categorical (string) and numeric(float and int) values such as;
school - abreviation of the name of a school
sex
age
address and so on.

- Stages of the execution of project:
a) preliminary analysis of the given data
b) counting of missing data
c) filling up the missing data (where applicable)
d) Exploratory Data Analysis
	Clear outliers
	finding the statistically significant differences for features
e) summarization


- Self Reflection

I done this project alone without team
I liked how to proceed with the data by spreading it out by categories (objective or numerical) and proceed it using loops.
Also, I liked to work and proceed with the categorical data with further making correlation of it.
However, so far my knowledge is not full in statistics so then I got some troubles with how to interpret some of the output.
I really got a lot of pieces of knowledge during the execution of this project, such as basic statistics, plotting nice pictures, how to proceed with the markdowns in the jupyter.
My main result is (I suppose) is that I got deep knowledge of pandas and how to work with it. Also, I got an understanding of how powerful Python and it really can do a lot (but slow sometimes).
I think I could do more data pre-processing.

Do I plan to learn additional info? Of Course. Especially statistics (and it is interesting)
